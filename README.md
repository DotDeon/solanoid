#Solanoid NFT Project

Solanoid was my very first NFT project where I was hired to work on the front-end. The project was built using React (NextJS) and TailwindCSS, and was hosted on Vercel. The goal of the project was to create a marketplace for Solana-based NFTs.


This project was a great opportunity for me to learn more about NFTs and the Solana blockchain. It was also a great experience working on a project that was part of the larger crypto and blockchain community.

However, it's worth noting that the Solanoid site is no longer in use, so the code is available on my GitHub repository for educational purposes only. Despite the project no longer being actively maintained or used, I am still proud of the work I did on it and what I learned during the process.

Conclusion
Solanoid was an exciting project that allowed me to dive deeper into the world of NFTs and learn more about the Solana blockchain. While the project is no longer in use, I am grateful for the experience and the opportunity to work on such a unique project.
